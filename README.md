# Chatty Chatty Bing Bing

Because I could not get Chitty Chitty Bang Bang out of my head when I was trying to come up with some name for a little chat app.

As of this writing, I have no idea who my target chatters are.

This follows Andrew Mead's Node course on Udemy. I will do what I can to add my own Katyness and Ihatetoastessence, but this exists for me to learn and refer back to. (It is a myth that you cannot end a sentence with a preposition.)

## Toolbox:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
